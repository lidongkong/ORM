npm init

This utility will walk you through creating a package.json file. 
It only covers the most common items, and tries to guess sane defaults.

See `npm help json` for definitive documentation on these fields and exactly what they do.

Use `npm install <pkg> --save` afterwards to install a package and save it as a dependency in the package.json file.

Press ^C at any time to quit.
